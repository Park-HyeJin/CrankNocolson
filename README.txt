Here, we upload the simulation codes and gunplot scripts for plotting figures for the papr. 

There are two folder including core codes.
One (CN) is for implementing the Crank-Nicolson algorithm to solve the reaction-diffusion equations on the two-dimensional lattice space at constant diffusion coefficients. 
The other (FE) is the code for the forward Euler method to solve the reacion-diffusion equation with density-dependent diffusion coefficients.

The test gunplot scripts and data are available in each folder.
