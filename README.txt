Here, we upload core codes for numerical calculation and gunplot scripts for plotting test figures.

There are two folders including the core code and the plotting script.
One (CN) is for implementing the Crank-Nicolson algorithm to solve the reaction-diffusion equations on the two-dimensional lattice space at constant diffusion coefficients. 
The other (FE) is the code for the forward Euler method to solve the reacion-diffusion equation with density-dependent diffusion coefficients.
The test gunplot scripts and data are available in each folder.
